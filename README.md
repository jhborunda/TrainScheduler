# TrainScheduler

The purpose of the Train Scheduler is for users using different machines, will be looking at the same Train Times regardless of their location with current times.

An admin whom will be adding the trains, should have access to inputing the follwing data:

1-Train Name
2-Destination
3-Frist Train Time
4-Frequency


The app will then/should calculate when the next train will arrive and minutes away the train is from the train station.

Please feel free to give this app a try!
